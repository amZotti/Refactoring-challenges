My outcome for this project is to become highly proficient in refactoring by the
end of this week. This is my intention because I want to write code that is more
durable, less brittle, and more beautiful. 

I am going to achieve this by focusing on chunking methods down by using the following 4 rules:

1) A class can be no longer than 100 lines of code

2) A method can be longer than 5 lines of code (excluding declaraiton and end)

3) A method can have no more than 4 arguments (including all arguments within a
hash)

4) All controllers can instantiate only one object
