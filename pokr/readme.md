The outcome of this program is to practice OOP design principles and using git
features. The purpose for this outcome is to enhance my OOP and overall computer
science skills at an accerated rate. 

I am going to accomplish this by writing a
poker program which generates poker hands and sorts the hands by value in the
context of the poker game, then displaying the results in either a text file or
using stout.

I will also accomplish my outcome by using the git features: creating my own readme, new folders, branching,
merging, and git pull request.
